# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report critical security issues on our Discord server or create an issue where we can share contact information.

We are happy about every report, but we can't promise that there will be bug bounties because we are only a small team and can't give away big rewards.

You will definitely be listed in the credits and depending on the situation we try to give small rewards.
